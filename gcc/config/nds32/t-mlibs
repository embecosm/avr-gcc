# We need to build following multilibs combinations:
#
#   1. <None multilibs>
#   2. -mlittle-endian
#   3. -mbig-endian
#   4. -mgp-direct
#   5. -mno-gp-direct
#   6. -mlittle-endian -mgp-direct
#   7. -mlittle-endian -mno-gp-direct
#   8. -mbig-endian -mgp-direct
#   9. -mbig-endian -mno-gp-direct
#
# We also define a macro MULTILIB_DEFAULTS in nds32.h that tells the
# driver program which options are defaults for this target and thus
# do not need to be handled specially.
MULTILIB_OPTIONS = mlittle-endian/mbig-endian mgp-direct/mno-gp-direct
