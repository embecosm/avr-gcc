/* Given a block B, update the CFG and SSA graph to reflect redirecting
   one or more in-edges to B to instead reach the destination of an
   out-edge from B while preserving any side effects in B.

   i.e., given A->B and B->C, change A->B to be A->C yet still preserve the
   side effects of executing B.

     1. Make a copy of B (including its outgoing edges and statements).  Call
	the copy B'.  Note B' has no incoming edges or PHIs at this time.

     2. Remove the control statement at the end of B' and all outgoing edges
	except B'->C.

     3. Add a new argument to each PHI in C with the same value as the existing
	argument associated with edge B->C.  Associate the new PHI arguments
	with the edge B'->C.

     4. For each PHI in B, find or create a PHI in B' with an identical
	PHI_RESULT.  Add an argument to the PHI in B' which has the same
	value as the PHI in B associated with the edge A->B.  Associate
	the new argument in the PHI in B' with the edge A->B.

     5. Change the edge A->B to A->B'.

	5a. This automatically deletes any PHI arguments associated with the
	    edge A->B in B.

	5b. This automatically associates each new argument added in step 4
	    with the edge A->B'.

     6. Repeat for other incoming edges into B.

     7. Put the duplicated resources in B and all the B' blocks into SSA form.

   Note that block duplication can be minimized by first collecting the
   set of unique destination blocks that the incoming edges should
   be threaded to.

   We reduce the number of edges and statements we create by not copying all
   the outgoing edges and the control statement in step #1.  We instead create
   a template block without the outgoing edges and duplicate the template.

   Another case this code handles is threading through a "joiner" block.  In
   this case, we do not know the destination of the joiner block, but one
   of the outgoing edges from the joiner block leads to a threadable path.  This
   case largely works as outlined above, except the duplicate of the joiner
   block still contains a full set of outgoing edges and its control statement.
   We just redirect one of its outgoing edges to our jump threading path.  */


/* Steps #5 and #6 of the above algorithm are best implemented by walking
   all the incoming edges which thread to the same destination edge at
   the same time.  That avoids lots of table lookups to get information
   for the destination edge.

   To realize that implementation we create a list of incoming edges
   which thread to the same outgoing edge.  Thus to implement steps
   #5 and #6 we traverse our hash table of outgoing edge information.
   For each entry we walk the list of incoming edges which thread to
   the current outgoing edge.  */

     also loop with several latch edges, or new subloops of the loop (although
     there are cases where it might be appropriate, it is difficult to decide,
     and doing it wrongly may confuse other optimizers).

     We could handle more general cases here.  However, the intention is to
     preserve some information about the loop, which is impossible if its
     structure changes significantly, in a way that is not well understood.
     Thus we only handle few important special cases, in which also updating
     of the loop-carried information should be feasible:

     1) Propagation of latch edge to a block that dominates the latch block
	of a loop.  This aims to handle the following idiom:

	first = 1;
	while (1)
	  {
	    if (first)
	      initialize;
	    first = 0;
	    body;
	  }

	After threading the latch edge, this becomes

	first = 1;
	if (first)
	  initialize;
	while (1)
	  {
	    first = 0;
	    body;
	  }

	The original header of the loop is moved out of it, and we may thread
	the remaining edges through it without further constraints.

     2) All entry edges are propagated to a single basic block that dominates
	the latch block of the loop.  This aims to handle the following idiom
	(normally created for "for" loops):

	i = 0;
	while (1)
	  {
	    if (i >= 100)
	      break;
	    body;
	    i++;
	  }

	This becomes

	i = 0;
	while (1)
	  {
	    body;
	    i++;
	    if (i >= 100)
	      break;
